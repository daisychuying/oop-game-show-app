# oop-game-show-app

In this project, I used Javascript and Object-Oriented Programming to create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter" which selects a random, hidden phrase and ask the player to guess by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen. If the player missed a letter, a heart will lose. The game continues until all the hearts are lost. The player will win if he or she guesses all the correct letter in the selected phrase.

I've included a Game, and a Phrase class in this project. Furthermore, I added some features including using 'keyup' to let players use their physical computer keyboard to enter guesses. Moreover, I change the background color of the board to randomly selected color and modify the transition of the keyboard button when the player hovers over the button.
